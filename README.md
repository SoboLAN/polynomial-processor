# Polynomial Processor

## OBSOLETE - no longer maintained

An "ancient" project written in Java and Swing that allows manipulation of polynomials of 1 variable with integer coefficients.

Depends on the [JFreeChart library](http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/) for displaying graphs of the equations.

Compiled binary is available in the `bin` directory.
